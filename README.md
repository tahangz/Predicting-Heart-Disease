# Predicting Heart Disease - End-to-End ML Project

![ML Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

## Description

Dive into the world of machine learning and discover how to design, train, and deploy end-to-end models with this comprehensive project. Through engaging, real-world examples and hands-on exercises, you'll learn to tackle complex data problems and build powerful ML models. By the end of this project, you'll be equipped with the skills needed to create, monitor, and maintain high-performing models that deliver actionable insights.

This project specifically focuses on **predicting heart disease** using various machine learning techniques, providing a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

## Features

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering and selection
* Training and evaluating multiple ML models
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Model deployment-ready pipeline

## Technologies

* Python 3.x
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
* Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tahangz/Predicting-Heart-Disease.git
cd Predicting-Heart-Disease
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

* Run Jupyter Notebook to explore the notebooks and learn the workflow step by step:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

* Execute the Python scripts for training, evaluating, and deploying models.
